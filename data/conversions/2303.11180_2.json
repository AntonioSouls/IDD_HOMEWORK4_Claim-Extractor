        "Table 2 presents the results of our SCAI method compared to other state-of-the-art methods on the challenging CrowdPose dataset. The methods compared include Mask-RCNN [12], SimpleBaseline [39], AlphaPose [8], OccNet [10], JC-SPPE [20], HigherHRNet [5], MIPNet [16], and SCIO [15]. Our SCAI method achieves an improvement in average precision by up to 0.9% compared to the current best method SCIO [15]. This indicates that our method can provide more accurate pose estimation for multi-person scenes with challenging occlusion scenarios."
