        "Table\u00a02 shows comparisons between our method and others on 3DHP dataset. D3DP reduces the MPJPE by 5.2mm on top of MixSTE\u00a0[68] in the single-hypothesis case (H\ud835\udc3bH=1). When H\ud835\udc3bH is increased to 20, the performance under J-Agg using JPMA is similar to P-Best and superior to P-Agg. Our method performs best when evaluated under J-Best. These results exhibit the same pattern as those on Human3.6M, which demonstrates the strong generalization capability of our method."
