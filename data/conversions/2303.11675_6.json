        "Which part benefits most? To understand the performance improvement of our method for each part, we provide per-part performance comparison results in Table\u00a06. We can see that compared with PARE, our approach has a slight error drop for the Hip joint, but the error drop for other joints is all above 10mm. Moreover, the errors of challenging joints such as the Wrist and Ankle reduce by 12mm and 13mm, respectively. The most significant error drop (by 19mm) is the Head joint."
