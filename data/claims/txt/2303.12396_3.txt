The user wants to extract claims from a table represented in a JSON format.
Each claim should have a "specifications" part based on the row header and value, a "Measure" extracted from the table, caption or references, and an "Outcome" which is the cell value corresponding to the measure.

The table can be of four types, but the extraction process should be similar. I need to iterate through each row of the table (excluding the header) and for each cell, create a claim. The column header will be the "Measure" and the row header will be used in the "specifications".

Steps:
1. Identify the table headers.
2. Iterate through each row of the table (starting from the second row).
3. For each cell in the row, extract the Measure (column header) and the Outcome (cell value).
4. Extract the Specifications based on the row header.

Let's consider the example provided:
```json
{
    "table": [
        [
            "Method",
            "AP",
            "AP50",
            "AP75"
        ],
        [
            "Center†",
            "80.0",
            "98.6",
            "89.1"
        ],
        [
            "Center",
            "80.2",
            "98.6",
            "89.5"
        ],
        [
            "Ours†",
            "84.2",
            "99.3",
            "96.2"
        ],
        [
            "Ours",
            "85.0",
            "99.4",
            "97.4"
        ],
        [
            "Oracle†",
            "84.8",
            "99.6",
            "97.2"
        ],
        [
            "Oracle",
            "85.7",
            "99.6",
            "97.9"
        ]
    ],
    "caption": "Table 3: Ablation study of different strategies on YCB.\r\nWe compare the center-based and the proposed visibility-guided sampling strategies used with standard NMS (denoted by ††\\dagger) or with our fusion strategy. Our method is more accurate than the baseline strategies and performs on par with the oracle one that relies on guided sampling from the ground-truth mask. Here, “Center†” corresponds to the strategy of FCOSv2\xa0[44].\r\n",
    "references": [
        "Ablation study on YCB.\r\nWe compare NMS and our fusion strategy on a model trained either with the centered-based strategy or the proposed visibility-guided one.\r\nAs shown in Table\xa03, with the same NMS post-processing, our sampling strategy already outperforms the center-based baseline by 4.2 points. This confirms the importance of involving all the visible object parts during training, leveraging the rigidity of the targets. Furthermore, both sampling strategies benefit from our fusion method discussed in Section\xa03.3. However, it only increases the performance of the center-based one by 0.2 points, which highlights the drawback of not using non-center areas during training, making the fusion during inference less effective. By contrast, our fusion method increases the performance of our sampling strategy by 0.8 points, making it perform on par with the oracle that uses the ground-truth mask to guide sampling."

The first row is the header. For each subsequent row, each cell represents a claim.
For example, for the row `["Center†", "80.0", "98.6", "89.1"]`:
- For "80.0": Measure is "AP", Outcome is "80.0", Specification is {"name": "Method", "value": "Center†"}
- For "98.6": Measure is "AP50", Outcome is "98.6", Specification is {"name": "Method", "value": "Center†"}
- For "89.1": Measure is "AP75", Outcome is "89.1", Specification is {"name": "Method", "value": "Center†"}```json
