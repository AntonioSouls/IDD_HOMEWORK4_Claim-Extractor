The user wants to extract claims from a table provided in a JSON format.
Each claim should follow a specific JSON structure with "specifications", "Measure", and "Outcome".
The "specifications" come from the column headers and corresponding row value.
The "Measure" can be found in the table, caption, or references.
The "Outcome" is the value associated with the "Measure".

Let's analyze the example provided:
Table:
[['Model', 'Comp. Cost', 'Comp. Cost', 'Shape Accuracy', 'Shape Accuracy'],
 ['Model', 'Time', 'Memory', 'Chair', 'Table'],
 ['DIST [22]', '0.27 sec', '5.4 GB', '1.28', '1.43'],
 ['DeepDDF', '0.04 sec', '5.0 GB', '0.83', '0.91']]
Caption: 'Table 2: Experimental comparison of shape reconstruction speed and accuracy of DeepDDF with DIST. Accuracy is shown in Chamfer distances (10−3)superscript103(10^{-3}) from ground truth. Our DeepDDF realizes more accurate reconstruction in an order of magnitude less time.'
References: []

Observations:
- The table has a multi-index header.
- "Comp. Cost" and "Shape Accuracy" are top-level headers.
- "Time", "Memory", "Chair", "Table" are sub-headers.
- The caption mentions "speed" and "accuracy". "Accuracy" seems to relate to "Shape Accuracy". The unit of accuracy is "Chamfer distances (10−3)".
- "Speed" likely relates to "Comp. Cost", with the unit being time.

Plan:
1. Iterate through each row of the table (starting from the data rows).
2. For each cell in a row, identify the corresponding column headers.
3. Create "specifications" based on the model name.
4. Identify the "Measure" and "Outcome" based on the column headers.```json
