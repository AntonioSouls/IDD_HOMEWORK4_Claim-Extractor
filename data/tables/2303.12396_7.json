        "General scenario. Our work is motivated by the rigidity of the targets in 6D object pose estimation. The general scenario, e.g., COCO, does not fully match our assumption. Nevertheless, we report results with the same experimental setting as FCOSv2 and PAA in Table\u00a07. In addition to the average accuracy across the 80 COCO categories, we report the accuracy of the 5 categories on which our method outperforms the baselines the most, and the 5 categories on which our method performs the worst. Our method outperforms the baselines significantly on categories such as toaster, bottle, etc., which are mainly rigid objects. By contrast, the categories on which our method underperforms include cat, dog, etc., which are mainly non-rigid targets and break our assumption. Our method nevertheless achieves similar performance to the baselines in average accuracy."
