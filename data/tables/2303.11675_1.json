        "Comparison to the state-of-the-art.\r\nWe first comprehensively compare BoPR with three types of state-of-the-art methods, including video-based, model-free, and model-based methods on the 3DPW dataset. In this experiment, we report two evaluation results, namely 3DPW-ALL and 3DPW-TEST. Here, all methods do not include the 3DPW training dataset in training to evaluate the 3DPW-ALL setting, while for the 3DPW-TEST, they all fine-tune the network on the 3DPW training dataset. In addition, we provide the results of two network structures (HR-W48 and HR-W32) on these two settings, respectively. Table\u00a01 presents the comparison results with various methods. Our method\u2019s performance using the HR-W32 backbone network has surpassed almost all existing methods in all metrics but is only slightly lower PVE than the CLIFF method using the HR-W48 backbone network. However, when using the HR-W48 backbone network, our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CLIFF on 3DPW-TEST, and MJE is reduced from 69.0 to 65.4. It is also worth mentioning that the evaluation results in 3DPW-ALL can better reflect the generalization ability of the method. Yet, in this setting, our method also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method HybrIK by a large margin (MJE from 80.0 to 72.0)."
