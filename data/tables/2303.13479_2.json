        "We conduct experiments on a larger dataset, Wild6D\u00a0[10], to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. We directly test our model which are trained on REAL275 and CAMERA25 datasets without extra fine-tuning. The results are reported in Tab\u00a02. It can be observed that IST-Net is much better than those designed for the REAL275 dataset and has an obvious improvement in various matrices. Compared with RePoNet\u00a0[10] and Self-Pose\u00a0[39] both of which are trained upon Wild6D, our method shows good generalization without\r\nfine-tuning on the target dataset. We achieve the highest performance of 93.4 and 79.6 on 3D25subscript\ud835\udc3725D_{25} and 3D50subscript\ud835\udc3750D_{50}. As for other metrics, our method can also reach a similar performance to Self-Pose. These analysis and results demonstrate the potential of our method."
