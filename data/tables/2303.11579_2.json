When H\ud835\udc3bH is increased to 20, the performance under J-Agg using JPMA is similar to P-Best and superior to P-Agg. Our method performs best when evaluated under J-Best. These results exhibit the same pattern as those on Human3.6M, which demonstrates the strong generalization capability of our method."
